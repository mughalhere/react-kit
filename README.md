When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with <code>npm run build</code>
<h2><b>Get Started Immediately</b></h2>
You don’t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.
Just clone the repo, and you’re good to go.
<h2><b>Creating an App</b></h2>
You’ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine
(but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to easily switch Node 
versions between different projects.
